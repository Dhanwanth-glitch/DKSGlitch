        <dt><b>Front End</b></dt>
        <dd>The front-end of a web application is the client-side of the development process, responsible for creating the user interface and user experience that users interact with. Front-end developers use a combination of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft a visually appealing and functional interface that allows users to access and interact with the application. This includes designing and building the layout, typography, color scheme, and overall aesthetic of the site, as well as implementing interactive elements such as buttons, forms, and navigation menus. Front-end developers must also ensure that the site is responsive and adaptable across various devices and browsers, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. Additionally, they must also focus on performance optimization, ensuring that the site loads quickly and efficiently, and is accessible to users with disabilities. By balancing aesthetics, usability, and functionality, front-end developers can create a seamless and engaging experience for users, ultimately driving user engagement and conversion.</dd>

        <dt><b>Back End</b></dt>
        <dd>The back-end of a web application is the server-side of the development process, responsible for managing the underlying infrastructure and data storage of the application. Back-end developers use programming languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java to design and build the server-side logic, database integration, and API connectivity that powers the application's functionality. This includes creating databases, developing data models, and implementing data retrieval and processing algorithms to manage user input and requests. Back-end developers must also ensure that the application's data is secure, scalable, and reliable, using techniques such as encryption, authentication, and load balancing to protect against potential threats and handle increased traffic. Additionally, back-end developers may also be responsible for integrating with third-party services, such as payment gateways or social media platforms, to enable additional features and functionality. By building a robust and efficient back-end infrastructure, developers can ensure that the application can handle a large volume of users, process complex data sets, and provide a seamless user experience.</dd>
